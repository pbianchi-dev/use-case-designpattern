Descriptions of Implementation Cases:
1. Implement User Validation:
• Description: Develop and test a user validation component to ensure that the input data provided by users is valid and secure.
2. Create Dependency Injection Service:
• Description: Implement a dependency injection service to allow system components to be easily injected and swapped, promoting loose coupling and testability.
3. Develop Factory Method:
• Description: Create a factory method that encapsulates object creation logic, allowing flexibility in creating different types of objects as needed.
4. Establish Observation Mechanism:
• Description: Develop an observation mechanism that allows observer objects to be automatically notified of changes in the state of an observed object, promoting asynchronous communication between system components.
5. Implement Singleton Manager:
• Description: Create a singleton manager that ensures only one instance of a particular class is created and provides a global access point to that instance throughout the system.
